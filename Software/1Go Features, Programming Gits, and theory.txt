Swarm Function ideas

-Have swarm automatically move captured stones to captured area/”bowl” and then self rearrange
-Automatically organize swarm into “go bowl” area (probably should use 2 receivers, one for black and one for white and assign unique Ids like 1b, 2b, 1w, 2w, etc)
-Have “go bowl” swarm automatically pop one out for next move after playing current move/during other player's turn
-Go bowl and captured areas need to have space for 41/181 bots on each players side (something like 4x5 array and 13x14, can change ratios to make everything fit in projected space)
-Automatically score game(can manually move pieces to make adjustments/score corrections), winner has two bots move from go bowl and loser has 1 move out
-Pass function (put the bot that popped out back into the go bowl)
-Resign function (take two bots out of resignee's captured bots bowl)
